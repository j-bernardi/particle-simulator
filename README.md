# particle-simulator
An undergraduate project in orbital simulation in C++


PlanetSim.exe takes initial conditions in 2 or 3d on the command line (or can be run with no arguments). A file with planetary inputs must be specified in the command line (see directory 'inputs' for examples)

Outputs column data that can be plotted in gnuplot to make gifs of planetary orbits in 2d or 3d.

E.g. PlanetSim.exe > txt.txt
